An example notebook of the MX to TF transformation of the ArcFace models. Can be directly applicable for *LResNet100E-IR,ArcFace@ms1m-refine-v2*, *LResNet50E-IR,ArcFace@ms1m-refine-v1*, *LResNet34E-IR,ArcFace@ms1m-refine-v1*. By analogy, *MobileFaceNet,ArcFace@ms1m-refine-v1* can be transformed by slight modifications.

In response to [this](https://github.com/papermsucode/advhat/issues/11) issue.
